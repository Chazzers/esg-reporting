			ESG is an abbreviation which means Environment, Social and Governance. These pillars are the
			main themes in the “Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive” (CSRD). The CSRD is part of
			the “Green Deal” of the European Union and is aiming for the improvement of the sustainability
			for companies internally and als how these companies impact the world externally.
		</p>
		<p>
			This combination of internal and external is called “double materiality”. Because of this
			concept, the amount of metrics companies can potentially report on are extremely large. The
			company responsible for setting the reporting standards, EFRAG, have estimated that there are
			~1144 potential datapoints.
		</p>
		<p>
			The goal of the CSRD is to increase economic flow to sustainable companies while stimulating
			companies to do better on ESG topics.
